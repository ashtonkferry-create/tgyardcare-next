## Accumulated Context

### From v1.0 Milestone
- Supabase project: mxhalirruvyxdkppjsqf.supabase.co
- GitHub repo: TotalGuardYardCare/tgyardcarecom
- Existing Lovable codebase in tgyardcare/ directory (React SPA)
- Admin dashboard pre-existing with leads, SEO, content panels
- Two domains: tgyardcare.com + totalguardyardcare.com

### Key Technical Notes
- Existing Supabase has 16 tables — new schema EXTENDS, doesn't replace
- Lovable site is Vite/React SPA — new site is Next.js App Router (complete rewrite)
- Existing contact_submissions table should be preserved/migrated to new leads table
- Vercel account: ashtonkferry-create
