---

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Revenue Engine)
Plan: 3 of 9 complete (01-01 ✓, 01-02 ✓, 01-09 ✓)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-15 -- Completed 01-09-PLAN.md (Brevo email marketing system — 6 HTML templates, 10 campaigns, 27 Twilio→Brevo SMS migrations)

Progress: [===-----] 3/9 plans (33%)

Executing Milestone 2: Close Every Gap Against TTW
- Phase 0 (Fix Existing): PLANNING -- ready to execute
- Phase 1 (Revenue Engine): EXECUTING -- 01-01 COMPLETE, 01-02 COMPLETE, 01-03 through 01-08 pending
- Phase 2 (CRM Unification): Not started
- Phase 3 (SEO Domination): Not started
- Phase 4 (Intelligence Layer): Not started

## Key Decisions
- Milestone 1 (88 n8n workflows) partially complete -- workflows exist but many non-functional
- Full audit completed 2026-03-13: TG has 121+ automations across 3 layers (n8n, Vercel crons, self-healing SEO)
- 25 active TTW capabilities with zero TG equivalent identified
- Phase 0 is pure configuration -- no code changes needed
- Revenue-first ordering: Phase 1 before CRM before SEO before Intelligence
- 01-01: Used source='other' for fertilizer customer leads (not 'manual' -- not in CHECK constraint)
- 01-01: Created 4 fertilizer customers in leads table (didn't exist previously)
- 01-01: Permissive RLS on automation tables (service_role_all)
- 01-02: TG-05 remains inactive until sub-workflow IDs are populated (n8n can't activate with empty executeWorkflow refs)

## Critical Reference Data
- TG-05 Workflow ID: Jf5VYdWpDs3VgRzd
- TG-05 Sub-workflow node IDs: call-tg83, call-tg84, call-tg86, call-tg88, call-tg89

## Blockers
- GBP API quota approval pending since 2026-03-08 (Google manual review)
- Several API keys need Vance to create accounts (Facebook, OpenWeatherMap, etc.)
- Jobber OAuth handshake needs manual browser flow
- TG-05 inactive until TG-83/84/86/88/89 are created and IDs backfilled

## Next Actions
1. Execute 01-03 through 01-08 plans (Phase 1 Revenue Engine Wave 1-4)
2. After sub-workflows created, backfill TG-05 workflowId fields and activate
3. Execute Phase 0 plan (12 configuration tasks) -- still pending
4. Vance: Add Cloudflare DNS records for Brevo domain auth (see automation/docs/brevo-setup-guide.md)
5. Vance: Set TG_BREVO_API_KEY in n8n instance (Settings → Variables)
