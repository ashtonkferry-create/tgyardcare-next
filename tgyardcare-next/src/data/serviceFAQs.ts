  {
    question: "How often should I have my lawn mowed?",

  },
  {
    question: "What height do you cut the grass?",
    answer: "We follow best practices and typically maintain grass at 3-3.5 inches. This height promotes healthy root growth, reduces weeds, and helps your lawn stay green during dry periods. We can adjust based on grass type and your preferences."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you bag or mulch the clippings?",
    answer: "We mulch clippings back into your lawn, which naturally fertilizes and retains moisture. If you prefer bagging, or if the grass is extremely long, we can bag and haul away clippings for an additional fee."
  },
  {
    question: "What if it rains on my scheduled mowing day?",

  },
  {
    question: "How deep should mulch be applied?",
    answer: "We apply 2-3 inches of fresh mulch, which is the ideal depth for weed suppression and moisture retention without suffocating plant roots. If existing mulch is present, we'll top-dress to achieve proper depth."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I mulch my beds?",
    answer: "Most properties benefit from fresh mulch annually, typically in spring. Mulch naturally breaks down and fades over time. Annual application keeps beds looking fresh and provides ongoing benefits."

    question: "Do you edge the beds before mulching?",
    answer: "Yes! We re-edge all beds to create clean, defined borders before applying mulch. This professional touch makes a dramatic difference in curb appeal."

    answer: "Absolutely. We use professional-grade products that are safe once dried (2-4 hours). We schedule applications during off-hours when possible and provide signage as required. All products meet commercial safety standards."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide service documentation for property managers?",
    answer: "Yes! We provide detailed service reports after each application including date, products used, areas treated, weather conditions, and recommendations. Essential documentation for property management and tenant records."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you treat only problem areas or do you require full-property service?",
    answer: "We offer both targeted spot treatments and comprehensive property-wide programs. Many clients start with full programs for overall health, then transition to maintenance programs focusing on problem areas."
  },
  {
    question: "What results can we expect from a commercial fertilization program?",
    answer: "Expect thicker, greener turf within 2-3 weeks, significant weed reduction after 4-6 weeks, improved drought resistance, and professional appearance year-round. Results compound over time with consistent programs."

  {
    question: "How often should bushes and shrubs be trimmed?",
    answer: "Most bushes and shrubs benefit from trimming 1-3 times per year depending on the species and growth rate. Fast-growing shrubs like privet may need trimming every 6-8 weeks during growing season, while slower-growing evergreens may only need annual shaping. We'll assess your specific plants and recommend the optimal schedule."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best time of year for pruning?",
    answer: "The ideal pruning time varies by plant type. Spring-flowering shrubs should be pruned right after blooming, while summer-flowering plants are best pruned in late winter or early spring. Evergreens can be pruned in late spring or early summer. We time our pruning services to promote healthy growth and maximize flowering."
  },
  {
    question: "Will pruning damage my plants?",
    answer: "When done correctly by professionals, pruning promotes healthier, more attractive plants. We follow proper pruning techniques that encourage new growth, improve air circulation, and maintain the natural shape of your shrubs. Improper pruning can harm plants, which is why professional service is important."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you haul away the trimmings?",
    answer: "Yes! All clippings and debris are removed from your property and properly disposed of. We leave your landscape clean and tidy with no mess left behind. This is included in our standard pruning service at no additional charge."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you restore overgrown or neglected bushes?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We specialize in rejuvenation pruning for overgrown shrubs. Depending on the severity, we may recommend gradual pruning over 2-3 seasons to restore shape without shocking the plant. We'll assess your bushes and provide a restoration plan with realistic expectations."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does bush trimming cost?",
    answer: "Pricing depends on the number of bushes, their size, accessibility, and how overgrown they are. Most residential properties range from $150-$400 per visit. We provide free estimates and can set up regular maintenance schedules for better pricing. Contact us for a personalized quote based on your specific needs."

  {
    question: "When is the best time for commercial lawn aeration?",
    answer: "The optimal time depends on your grass type. Cool-season grasses (common in Madison) benefit most from fall aeration (September-October) when soil moisture and temperatures support recovery. Spring aeration (April-May) is also effective. We schedule around your business operations for minimal disruption."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should commercial properties be aerated?",
    answer: "High-traffic commercial properties typically need annual aeration, while lower-traffic areas may only need aeration every 2-3 years. Properties with heavy clay soil or significant foot traffic often benefit from twice-yearly service. We'll assess your property's specific needs and recommend the optimal schedule."
  },
  {
    question: "Will aeration disrupt our business operations?",
    answer: "We minimize disruption by scheduling around your business hours and completing work efficiently with commercial-grade equipment. Most properties can be aerated in a single day. The small plugs left on the lawn break down naturally within 1-2 weeks and pose no hazard to foot traffic."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between residential and commercial aeration?",
    answer: "Commercial aeration requires larger, more powerful equipment to handle bigger properties and heavily compacted soil. We use commercial-grade core aerators that pull deeper plugs and cover ground more efficiently. We also provide documentation and work around business schedules."
  },
  {
    question: "Should we combine aeration with overseeding?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Aeration creates the perfect conditions for overseeding success. The cores create seed-to-soil contact, and the holes allow seeds to germinate protected from traffic. We recommend combining these services for maximum turf improvement, especially for thin or stressed lawns."
  },
  {
    question: "How long until we see results from aeration?",
    answer: "You'll notice improved water penetration immediately. Within 2-3 weeks, the soil plugs break down and grass begins responding with deeper root growth. Full benefits—thicker turf, better drought resistance, improved color—develop over 4-8 weeks as the root system expands."
