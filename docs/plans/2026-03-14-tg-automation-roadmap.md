# TotalGuard Automation Roadmap — TG vs TTW Gap Map + Build Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan phase-by-phase.

**Goal:** Close every gap between TotalGuard (TG) and TotalWash (TTW), fix broken credentials, and build the ~45 missing workflows to reach ~127 fully-operational automations.

**Reference:** TTW = TotalWash (competitor reference system with 250 workflows, 67 active)
**Current reality:** TG has 82 workflows defined, ~35 actually functional today due to missing API keys.

---

## SCOREBOARD

| | TotalGuard (TG) | TotalWash (TTW) |
|--|---|---|
| Total workflows | 82 | 250 |
| Active in n8n | 78 | 67 |
| Actually functional | ~35 | ~67 |
| Missing credentials | ~20 | Unknown |
| Jobber plan | **Connect ($60/mo grandfathered)** — has Zapier, Automatic Payments | — |
| CRM integration depth | Zapier → n8n webhooks (upgrading from email parsing) | Full API (webhooks, sync, proxy) |
| Communication layer | Scattered | Unified CRM layer (250–254) |
| Financial automation | None | Plan enrollment, payment plans, invoice delivery |
| Programmatic SEO | None | City pages, GSC sync, rank alerts, content gaps |
| Crew operations | Basic briefings | Territory assignment, auto-dispatch, bonus calc |

**Honest headline:** TG built 82 workflows but ~43 are silently failing from missing credentials. Fix those first — you jump from ~35 to ~55+ functional automations at zero build cost. Then build the ~45 missing workflows to reach ~127 total.

---

## JOBBER CONNECT — WHAT IT ALREADY DOES (DO NOT DUPLICATE IN N8N)

**Plan confirmed:** You are on a **grandfathered Connect plan at $60/month** (legacy annual pricing). This is the $119/mo plan's features at half price — a significant advantage.

**Critical:** Before building any workflow, check this table. Building n8n automation for something Jobber already handles = double messages to customers.

### What Jobber Connect Sends AUTOMATICALLY (no setup needed)

| Event | Jobber Does It? | Method | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Online booking request confirmation | ✅ AUTO | Email | Fires when client submits your booking form |
| Quote delivery to client | Manual send → auto delivery | Email (+ optional SMS) | You click Send; Jobber delivers |
| Quote approval confirmation to client | ✅ AUTO | Email | Fires the instant client approves in Client Hub |
| **Pre-visit reminder (day before)** | ✅ AUTO — Connect feature | Email + SMS | **Connect plan includes this natively. Check if toggled ON in Settings before building in n8n.** |
| **Overdue invoice reminders** | ✅ AUTO — Connect feature | Email | Connect sends automated follow-up on unpaid invoices. Check interval in Settings. |
| Post-job follow-up / thank you | ✅ AUTO (toggle) | Email or SMS | **Toggle in Settings → Job Follow-ups. CHECK IF THIS IS ON.** If on, do NOT build a duplicate in n8n. |
| Payment receipt | ✅ AUTO (requires Jobber Payments) | Email | Fires when client pays through Client Hub |
| Signed document confirmation | ✅ AUTO | Email | Fires when a document is signed |

### Recurring Jobs + Automatic Payments (FULLY AUTOMATED — DO NOT TOUCH IN N8N)

Connect plan includes **Automatic Payments**. If a recurring job client has a saved card via Jobber Payments, Jobber handles the entire billing cycle with zero human input:

- ✅ Invoice auto-created when visit completes
- ✅ Card auto-charged at configured frequency (per-visit or fixed)
- ✅ Receipt auto-emailed to client
- ✅ Invoice marked paid automatically

**Any n8n invoice workflow must check if a customer has Automatic Payments before firing. If they do — skip them. If they don't — fire the sequence.**

This affects TG-84 (invoice collections) and TG-89 (invoice delivery). Both workflows need a filter: `IF customer.automatic_payments = true → stop`.

### What Jobber Connect Does NOT Do (Build These in N8N)

| Automation | Jobber Connect Does It? | Build in N8N? |
|---|---|---|
| Quote follow-up (unanswered quotes) | ❌ NO — Grow only | ✅ BUILD TG-83 |
| Google review request | ❌ NO — $39/mo add-on | ✅ HAVE TG-18 |
| On My Way SMS | ❌ NO — Grow only | ✅ BUILD TG-88 |
| Two-way SMS inbox | ❌ NO — Grow only | ✅ HAVE TG-76 |
| Invoice delivery — one-off jobs (send invoice via Brevo) | Jobber sends invoice link; n8n sends branded Brevo email | ✅ BUILD TG-89 (one-off customers only, with Automatic Payments filter) |
| Upsell / cross-sell emails | ❌ NO | ✅ HAVE TG-10 |
| Loyalty / NPS / review sequences | ❌ NO | ✅ HAVE TG-60, TG-61 |
| Missed call AI fallback | ❌ NO | ✅ BUILD TG-85 |
| Revenue attribution / analytics | ❌ NO | ✅ BUILD in Phase 4 |

### Zapier Integration (Connect Feature — You Have This)

**You have Zapier.** This changes TG-05 entirely.

- TG-05 (Jobber email parser) is the fragile path — parses notification emails via IMAP, breaks when Jobber changes email format
- **Zapier path**: Jobber → Zapier trigger → n8n webhook. Cleaner, more reliable, more event types
- **Recommendation for TG-05 rewrite**: Replace IMAP email parsing with a Zapier webhook trigger sending structured job/quote/invoice data to n8n

Zapier events available with Connect:
| Jobber Event | Zapier Trigger | N8N Action |
|---|---|---|
| New job | Job Created | → TG routing |
| Job completed | Job Completed | → TG-18 (review) + TG-61 (loyalty) + TG-89 (invoice) |
| Quote approved | Quote Approved | → TG-08 (welcome) + TG-77 (booking) |
| Invoice created | Invoice Created | → TG-89 (one-off check) |
| New client | Client Created | → TG-01 / CRM sync |
| Payment received | Payment Created | → TG-65 (upsell) + TG-34 (referral check) |

**Phase 0 action**: Rewrite TG-05 to use a Zapier webhook trigger instead of IMAP email parsing.

### Critical Action Before Building

**Check right now in Jobber → Settings → Emails and Text Messages:**

1. **Job Follow-ups** — if ON, Jobber sends a post-job message. TG-18 (review request) waits 24hr — safe. But any "job complete thank you" n8n workflow would duplicate.
2. **Appointment Reminders** — Connect sends pre-visit reminders natively. If ON, do NOT build a pre-visit reminder in n8n.
3. **Invoice Reminders** — Connect sends overdue invoice follow-ups natively. If ON, TG-84 would duplicate these for Automatic Payments customers.

### What Upgrading to Grow Would Unlock

| Plan | Cost | Unlocks for N8N | Worth It When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grow ($199/mo) | +$140/mo | Full GraphQL API + real-time webhooks (eliminates Zapier entirely), custom automations builder, two-way SMS | Revenue >$15k/mo and real-time sync matters |

**You are already on Connect. Do NOT downgrade. Re-evaluate Grow at $15k MRR.**

## PART 3 — EXECUTION ROADMAP

### Phase 0 — Fix What's Broken (Week 1, ~2 hours of credential gathering)
**9 workflows silently failing. Fix these before building anything new.**

| # | Fix | Workflow | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Wrong IMAP account | TG-05 | Set Jobber to forward notifications to `totalguardllc@gmail.com`, update n8n credential, re-enable |
| F2 | Google Places key missing | TG-19, TG-39 | Create Google Cloud project → enable Places API → get key → fill both workflows |
| F3 | Google Places ID missing | TG-19 | Query Places API for TotalGuard place ID → fill in workflow |
| F4 | Fix internal webhook URLs | TG-19 | Replace `https://n8n.instance/...` → `https://tgyardcare.app.n8n.cloud/...` |
| F5 | Facebook token missing | TG-35, TG-40, TG-41 | Meta Business Suite → System User → generate token → fill 3 workflows |
| F6 | GSC OAuth missing | TG-45 | Create Google Search Console OAuth2 credential in n8n → authorize |
| F7 | IndexNow key missing | TG-47 | Generate key → upload to tgyardcare.com/{key}.txt → fill workflow |
| F8 | Wrong sender email | TG-65, TG-67 | Replace `workelyhelp@gmail.com` → `vance@tgyardcare.com` |
| F9 | Lob API key missing | TG-33 | Either get Lob key OR disable the workflow |

**Verification:** After each fix, manually trigger the workflow and confirm execution log shows success, not failure.

---

### Phase 1 — Revenue-Critical Builds (Week 1–2)
**Builds that directly recover or create revenue. Do these before SEO or ops.**

### Phase 3 — SEO Growth Engine (Week 3–4)

#### TG-103: GSC Daily Sync (prerequisite for most SEO workflows)
```
Trigger: Cron — daily 5am CT
→ Pull last 3 days of Google Search Console data via OAuth
→ Extract: queries, pages, clicks, impressions, position
→ Upsert to Supabase gsc_data table
→ This feeds: TG-45 (rank tracker), TG-104 (rank drop alert), TG-107 (opportunity detector)
```
*Build this first — it's the data foundation for all other SEO workflows.*

#### TG-104: Rank Drop Alert
```
Trigger: Cron — daily 7am CT (after TG-103 runs)
→ Compare today's GSC data vs 7 days ago
→ Any keyword dropped >5 positions?
→ SMS owner: "⚠️ Rank drop: '[keyword]' fell from #[X] to #[Y] — check tgyardcare.com/[page]"
→ Log to Supabase
```

#### TG-105: AI Blog Content Pipeline
```
Trigger: Cron — Mon/Wed/Fri 6am CT
→ Pull content calendar from Supabase (topics Claude suggested in TG-36)
→ Claude writes full blog post (1200-1500 words) with:
    - Local Madison references
    - Target keyword in title, H2s, meta
    - Internal links to service pages
    - FAQ schema markup
→ Save draft to Supabase blog_posts table with status: "pending_review"
→ SMS owner: "New blog draft ready: '[title]' — review at [CMS link]"
```

#### TG-106: City Content Generator
```
Trigger: Cron — monthly 1st 8am CT
→ Pull list of Madison neighborhoods from Supabase (Madison, Middleton, Fitchburg, Sun Prairie, Verona, etc.)
→ For each without a landing page:
    → Claude generates neighborhood-specific page content:
        - Local service area description
        - Neighborhood-specific lawn care tips
        - Local landmarks referenced naturally
        - LocalBusiness schema markup
    → Save to Supabase neighborhood_pages table
    → Submit URL to IndexNow via TG-47
→ SMS owner: "Generated [N] new city pages — ready for CMS upload"
```
